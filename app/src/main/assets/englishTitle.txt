O God Our Help In Ages Past 
One Day 
Take The Name Of Jesus 
Trusting Jesus 
At The Cross 
That Beautiful Name 
Jesus Is Calling 
What A Wonderful Saviour 
One Sweetly Solemn Thought 
Dwelling In Beulah Land 
We’ll Work Till Jesus 
Dare To Be A Daniel 
I Hear Thy Welcome Voice 
My Faith Looks Up 
Saved By Grace 
He Is Coming Again 
Nothing But The Blood 
Wounded For Me 
Alas, And Did My Saviour 
Take Me As I Am 
Love Divine 
Rescue The Perishing 
He Hideth My Soul 
Living For Jesus 
Take Time To Be Holy 
Spring Of Living Water 
Rock Of Ages 
I Am Satisfied With Jesus 
I’ve Found A Friend 
Mine Eyes Have Seen 
The Morning Light Is 
In The Cross Of Christ 
Shall We Gather At 
The Fight Is On 
Jesus Calls Us 
Trust And Obey 
Since Jesus Came Into 
Count Your Blessing 
What A Frien’d We Have 
He Leadeth Me 
The Great Physician 
Jesus Wants Me For A Sunbeam 
Draw Me Nearer 
God Be With You 
Nearer, Still Nearer 
Looking This Way 
Holy, Holy, Holy 
I Have A Saviour 
Tell It To Jesus 
Spirit Of God, Descend 
Anywhere With Jesus 
All The Way My Saviour Leads 
Weeping Will Not Save 
When The Roll Is Called 
Come To The Saviour 
Jesus Shall Reign  
Where My Saviour Leads 
Glory To His Name 
Beulah Land 
In The Garden 
Ring The Bells Of Heaven  
Carry Your Bible 
I Belong To The King 
Will Jesus Find Us Watching 
Under His Wings 
There Shall Be Showers 
Christ Receiveth Sinful Man 
There’ll Be No Dark Valley  
We Shall Meet 
Room For Thee 
Praise Him, Praise Him  
How Great Thou Art 
Numberless As The .Sands 
The Son Of God Goes Forth 
How Firm A Foundation 
Father Whate’er 
’Tis So Sweet To Trust 
Are You Washed In The Blood 
Believe On The Lord Jesus 
I Will Sing The Wondrous 
There Is A Fountain 
Tell Me The Old Old Story 
Whiter Than Snow  
Jesus Is All The World 
The Comforter Has Come 
Face To Face 
Saviour, Like A Shepherd 
Jesus Bids Us Shine 
Nearer, My God To Thee 
Sun Of My Soul 
The Name Of Jesus 
Safe In The Arms Of Jesus 
Faith Is The Victory 
Faith Of Our Fathers 
I’ve Something In My Heart 
I Need Thee Every Hour 
The Coming Of The Kingdom 
Hark The Herald Angels Sing  
O Little Town Of Bethlehem 
When Love Shines In 
A Charge To Keep I Have 
Is It The Crowning Day 
Jesus Saves 
My Jesus I Love Thee 
Am I A Soldier 
Have Thine Own Way 
There is Rest for the Weary 
Help Somebody Today  
Let The Lower Light Be 
A Mighty Fortress Is Our God 
Seeking For Me 
We’re Marching To Zion 
Almost Persuaded 
Come, Sinner Come 
Only Trust Him  
It Was A Glad Day 
All People That Dwell 
I Would Be Like Jesus 
Onward Christian Soldiers  
Sometime We’ll Understand 
Who Is On The Lord’s Side 
The Light Of The World 
The Way Of The Cross 
Saved, Saved 
Sweet By And By 
More Love To Thee 
Comfort Ye One Another 
We Praise Thee  God 
Satisfied 
The Cleansing Wave

I Love To Tell The Story 
I’ll Go Whore You Want Me 
Come Thou Almighty King 
Just As i Am 
Jesus Loves Me 
Work For The Night Is 
Wonderful Peace. 
Jesus Loves Even Me 
Whosoever Will

I Know That My Redeemer 
My Hope Is Built 
Stepping In The Light 
Does Jesus Care 
Walk In The Light

Majestic Sweetness 
He Keeps Me Singing 
I Was A Wandering Sheep

The Lily Of the Valley 
True-Hearted Whole-Hearted

Blessed Assurance 
The Best Friend To Have 
It’s Just Like His Love 
Why Do You Wait 
All Hail The Power (Diadem) 
All Hail The Power (Coronation) 
If You Want Joy (Chorus) 
Stand Up For Jesus 
How Sweet The Name 
Yield Not To Temptation 
Someone’s Last Call 
No, Never Alone 
If Your Heart Keeps Right

God Will Take Care 
I Must Tell Jesus 
I Shall Dpell Forever

Bring Them In 
There Is Power 
Joy To The World 
His Way With Thee 
Let Jesus Come Into 
Brighten The Corner 
He Is Mine 
Beautiful Isle 
Break Thou The Bread 
What If It Were Today 
Blest Be The Tie That Binds 
Love Lifted Me 
Whosoever Meaneth Me 
Softly And Tenderly 
Jesus Included Me 
No Longer Lonely 
The Old Rugged Cross 
And Can It Be 
He Lives On High 
Nor Silver Nor Gold 
On Jordan’s Stormy Banks 
A New Name In Glory 
Abide With Me 
 Surrender All 
Open My Eyes
